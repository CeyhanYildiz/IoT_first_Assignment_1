# IoT_first_Assignment_1

## Objective
For the first assignment, I expect you to understand what GitHub Actions are, how to use them, and how we will use them in the context of an embedded application running on the TUL PYNQ-Z2 platform. This is about 1/3rd of the functionality you'll have to implement in the final project! So, make sure you understand what is happening, and you'll have an easier time at the end.



## Task
You'll have to prepare the following.



1. Create a GitHub repository that is capable of running GitHub Actions
2. Create a small example program in C/C++, push this code into the aforementioned GitHub repository
3. Create a GitHub Actions workflow that compiles said C/C++ program
4. Create a—or edit the previous—GitHub Actions Workflow that compiles said C/C++ program for the TUL Pynq Z2


## Criteria for success
We'll grade you on the following 3 criteria.



1. Is your GitHub Actions workflow file in the correction location with correct YAML syntax?
2. Can your GitHub Actions workflow compile simple C/C++ programs from source?
3. Can your GitHub actions workflow compile simple C/C++ programs from source for a different target than the build/host machine?
